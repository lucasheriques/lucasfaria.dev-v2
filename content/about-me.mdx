I'd love to tell you more about me!

Okay, let's start with the professional side. I work as a software engineer, usually on the product side. Though I do want to get a platform role one day, as I believe there is value in the Product/Platform pendulum (plan to write about that some time).

So far on my career, I worked mostly in the <s>JavaScript</s> TypeScript world. That means Node, React, Nextjs (what I used to built this blog), and related technologies. Lately I've been working with product analytics, so I'm writing a lot of Python and SQL for data manipulation as well.

Database-wise, I worked extensively with DynamoDB from 2020 until 2023, and now I'm back to the relational databases world, mainly with PostgreSQL and MySQL.

I enjoy learning new languages on my spare time. I've been working on adding Golang to my toolbet. I built a [couple](https://github.com/lucasheriques/docker-go) of [projects](https://github.com/lucasheriques/redis-go) with it, and plan to build more soon.

Absolutely love UI engineering in general, with a passion for building products that feel like magic. Usually with a combination of Tailwind and Framer Motion.

I embrace <Link href="/bytes/on-building-software-craftsmanship">software craftsmanship</Link> as a way to find meaning in my work and my career.

## Work history

I worked mainly with small companies since 2016 to 2021. But then decided to also worker for larger tech companies like Coinbase and Brex (my current one).

Also worked on some projects on the side over these years.


## Hobbies

Coding is one of the main ones these days. I just like the feeling of building too much - but when I'm doing it on the side, it's not necessarialy the most production-ready stuff.
