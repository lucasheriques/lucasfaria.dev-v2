Here's the summary, and then you can decide if you wanna learn more:

- Product-minded software engineer. Focused on creating business value and understanding the 'why'.

- Main tools are TypeScript, Node, NextJS, React, React Native, SQL, and No-SQL databases. Usually deploying on AWS, Vercel or Convex.
- Ramping up on Kotlin (backend-focused), Go, Kubernetes and event-driven architectures (featuring Kafka).

Living together with my fiancée Iara since 2020 and our three little pets, Ayla, Luan, and Luna. I love coding, [cooking](https://receitas.lucasfaria.dev/), reading, nature, and animals! 🌵🐾📚🍳
