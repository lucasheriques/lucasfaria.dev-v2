Oh, you want to get to know me better? I feel glad for this opportunity!

Okay, let's start with the professional side. I work as a software engineer, usually on the product side. Though I do want to get a platform role one day, as I believe there is value in the Product/Platform pendulum (plan to write about that some time).

So far on my career, I worked mostly in the ~JavaScript~ TypeScript world. That means Node, React, Nextjs (what I used to built this blog), and related technologies. Lately I've been working with product analytics, so I'm writing a lot of Python and SQL for data manipulation as well.

However, I enjoy learning new languages on my spare time. I've been working on adding Golang to my toolbet. I built a [couple](https://github.com/lucasheriques/docker-go) of [projects](https://github.com/lucasheriques/redis-go) with it, and plan to build more soon.

I embrace <Link href="/bytes/on-building-software-craftsmanship">software craftsmanship</Link> as a way to find meaning in my work and my career.
