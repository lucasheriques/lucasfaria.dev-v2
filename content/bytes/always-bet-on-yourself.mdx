üôè Bet on yourself, but don't look for shortcuts!

I watched The Primeagen's talk on the hashtag #LaraconUS2024 and was struck by a powerful message:

1. Always bet on yourself: No matter how difficult it seems, you can overcome seemingly impossible challenges with dedication and constant effort.
2. But beware of shortcuts: Working 100 hours a week is not the answer. Value balance and know which battles to fight.

The Primeagen shared how he went from "worst student in 30 years" to senior engineer at Netflix. The key? Relentless determination and a willingness to take on challenges.

But he also warned: don't sacrifice relationships or your health in the process.

üí° My reflection: Sometimes we feel intimidated by new technologies or challenges. But remember: with time and dedication, you can master anything.

This is one of the wonders of being human. We are able to adapt to almost any situation.

At the same time, don't fall into the trap of thinking that you have to sacrifice everything for success. Find balance. ‚òØÔ∏é

Have you ever had an "impossible" moment that you overcame with dedication? Let me know, I'd love to hear about it.
