You have to be a loser.

Run that marathon and finish last.

Build a side project and make no money.

Apply for your dream job and get rejected.

Write online and watch people make fun of you.

Publish an educational video and get 0 views.

Everyone else did it and you aren't special.

Your failures will compound to success over time.

So learn to fail and learn how to live.

Normalize failing fast.
