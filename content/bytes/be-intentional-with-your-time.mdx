A few days ago, <Link href="/bytes/is-more-time-the-answer" target="_self">I talked about wanting more time</Link>. And that it's a matter of focusing on the right place.

But what about our tendency to procrastinate when we have a lot of time available? ðŸ˜…

I know I do that a lot.

And then, before I know it, time has passed (quickly), and I haven't made much progress.

Sometimes, it's necessary to put things into perspective for a few months from now. And set deadlines/check-ins that can keep us on track.

Because before we know it, it's already September 2024, and it feels like the year hasn't even started yet.

An example of mine: I've always wanted to have a blog and write content. Ever since I started working at Rock Content in 2016.

But it took me 8 years (!) to start something like that consistently.

Now, I force myself to write an article every week. Since May 13th.

And since I set this deadline for myself, my progress has been much more consistent.

Try doing something similar!

Make a commitment to do something, publicly. It could be recording a video, making a post here on LinkedIn, writing an article.

Or maybe learning an instrument. Going to the gym.

It doesn't have to be something work-related, or something that is 'productive'.

Just moving forward, and not watching time pass by in front of us as if we were just spectators of our own lives.
