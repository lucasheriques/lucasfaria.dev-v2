I always liked CSS arts. It seems to me like a web drawing, which is something I always wanted to get into.

However, the worst part for me had always been starting it out. I was always confused about how to organize the divs, and which styles to apply, among other things.

Now, with tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, the barrier is lower than ever.

It can start with most of the structure while we pair programs on it together.

In my experience, the tools are pretty good regarding the general structure and the form.

However, they tend to fail when figuring out animation keyframes and position. That's where I almost always have to take over.

I liked the result a lot! Try clicking on the coffee button.
