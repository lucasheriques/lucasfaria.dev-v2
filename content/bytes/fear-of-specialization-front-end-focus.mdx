This was originally answered on [Taro](https://www.jointaro.com/question/lIRFk3I46QqqEYFDlg4H/fear-of-picking-a-specializationniche-is-focusing-on-front-end-okay/), a community for software engineers looking to connect with other engineers, learn together and get promoted faster. I made slight edits to it.

I've been wondering this very same thing so that I can also add my thoughts. I also worked mainly in the frontend space.

Choosing to specialize in frontend development is okay.

In my career, I worked a lot on the frontend, especially in small startup environments, where the backend tends to be more straightforward.

I considered myself a full-stack engineer but later realized the depth in both areas.

In larger companies like Coinbase and Brex, I discovered the challenges of building distributed backend systems when scaling and serving more customers.

However, the front end also presents challenges like creating design systems, enhancing internal tools, ensuring accessibility, and handling complex UIs.

Frontend scalability is crucial, too. Making sure the architecture supports quick product changes. Ensure the UI can handle a lot of data and is blazingly fast. Your code is well organized and has proper testing and monitoring tools.

As a frontend developer, you're closer to the customer, collaborating with PMs and designers and participating in client research. This personal touch with users is a highlight of frontend work.

**Being a fullstack engineer, for me, is more than just handling both the frontend and backend. It's about combining software engineering skills to deliver real impact to users.**

This involves understanding user problems, designing solutions, guiding and upskilling others, demonstrating leadership, delivering projects, and aligning them with company goals.

A fullstack engineer with these broader skills is more valuable to a company and opens up growth opportunities.

Personally, I'm focusing on delivering impactful projects this year, emphasizing the highest leverage skills, whether in frontend, backend, system design, product management, analytics, UI design, or leadership, depending on the context.
