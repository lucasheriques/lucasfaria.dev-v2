Google has been replaced by ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor/Perplexity for me.

I used to say that the most important skill for a programmer is knowing how to search.

But Google search has gotten worse over the years.

Lots of ads, SEO-optimized articles that don't necessarily deliver the best content you're looking for.

It's become very difficult to trust the results at first.

Nowadays, if I search for something on Google, I often also need to validate whether what I read is true, especially if it's something I'm not 100% confident in.

Which can turn a 30-second doubt into 20 minutes.

Of course, we know that AI can hallucinate and deliver wrong results with the confidence that it's right.

And that's why knowing the basics is more important than ever.

In the future, we may not even write code anymore.

And that's why other skills, such as planning, leadership, system design and debugging will become increasingly important.
