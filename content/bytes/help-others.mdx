Help others.

Not just for their sake, but for yourself.

It's the best way to learn any skill quickly and with excellence.

I talked more about this [in this article](https://newsletter.nagringa.dev/p/melhor-jeito-de-aprender-qualquer-habilidade-rapidamente) (it's in Portuguese though).

But the main lesson is simple: learn in public.

Choose a platform. It doesn't matter which one. Substack, LinkedIn, Instagram, blog, whatever.

Make mistakes.

Learn from them.
