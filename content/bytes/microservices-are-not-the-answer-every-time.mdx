Microservices: The Double-Edged Sword of Software Architecture ðŸ”ª

Have you ever wondered why so many companies adopt microservices, even with all the challenges?

[Navdeep Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navdeep-singh-3aaa14161/) (founder of [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)) and [Matt Ranney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mranney/) (Principal Eng @ DoorDash) had an amazing conversation about microservices, and how they can be considered technical debt.

ðŸ“ˆ In the beginning, microservices are great:
Teams can work independently
Deployments become faster and more frequent
Scaling specific parts of the application becomes easier

ðŸ”„ But over time, complexity grows:
- A simple change can require 6 different deploys
- At DoorDash, 1 frontend call results in 1000 internal RPCs!
- Maintaining consistency between services becomes a nightmare

ðŸ§  The problem is sociotechnical:
- With a team of 5 devs, it's easy for everyone to have the context of the entire application. - With 300 devs, who defines the boundaries between services?
- How can we ensure that everyone follows the same standards?

ðŸ’¡ What can we do?
- Ask yourself if you really need microservices
- If you decide to use them, start with a few well-defined ones
- Invest heavily in observability tools
- Create clear standards for communication between services

ðŸ¤” What if there was a middle ground between monolith and microservices? Matt mentions in the video that the industry needs new abstractions.

Who knows what the next solution will be?
