This piece is inspired by my learnings from Part 1 of "Deep Work" by Cal Newport.

Hubert Dreyfus, a philosophy professor at Berkeley, along with Dorrance Kelly, the chair of Harvard's philosophy department, authored "All Things Shining." This book delves into how our perceptions of despair and meaning have shifted throughout human cultural history.

Remembering our history lessons, society was once centered around religious beliefs or a monarchy, where either God or the King was the focal point of existence.

However, in the post-Enlightenment era, the quest shifted towards seeking individual truths, as encouraged by Descartes. This quest for personal sacredness is challenging and may sometimes lead to nihilism, where nothing seems to hold true value, neither religious nor moral beliefs.

Craftsmanship emerges as a pathway to discovering meaning in our lives, providing a source of significance beyond the self.

By honing my software craftsmanship, I aim to achieve two goals:

Find greater meaning in my work across any industry. By focusing on the pursuit of excellence, my identity, and self-expression, I can develop software that extends my personal legacy. I relish in creating solutions for real-world problems, but above all, the process of software engineering offers an unparalleled state of focus and fulfillment.

Establish connections with users worldwide. As Marc Andreessen famously stated, "software is eating the world." This enables us to connect with people globally. Companies like Google, Facebook, Uber, and Airbnb have revolutionized societal functions, sometimes controversially, yet the impact of software on society is undeniable. This also opens opportunities for engineers to address issues previously unknown to them.

Santiago Gonzalez, a coding prodigy and Senior ML Research Engineer at Apple, once said:

"Beautiful code is short and concise. Sharing it with another programmer would likely earn praise for its craftsmanship, akin to the admiration one might have for a well-composed poem."

Let us strive to create software that will be our legacy, making our children proud. Software that feels like magic in action.
