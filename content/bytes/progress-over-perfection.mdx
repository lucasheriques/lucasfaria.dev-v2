Is anyone else a perfectionist? ðŸŒŸ

I feel like this is one of the traits that can most hinder our progress.

Throughout our lives, we will fail at times. It's completely normal.

However, this can sometimes make us afraid to try again. To take risks.

Instead, we need to strive for progress, not perfection.

An example of a recent failure of mine: I didn't get promoted in the last cycle.

Yes, this frustrates me.

But I know that I'm slowly getting closer. And valuing the feedback I've received about what I can improve will bring me great returns.

Yesterday, I had a 1:1 with a Principal Engineer here at Brex.

And he told me something valuable.

"Don't be afraid to ask 'dumb' questions.

For every good idea I have, you may have forgotten about the other 99 that everyone else told me and called me names.

This is the best way to learn quickly. Using other people's arguments as to why the idea/question won't work."

So don't be afraid to make mistakes or fail.

**The important thing is to keep moving forward.**
