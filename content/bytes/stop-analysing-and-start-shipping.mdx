title: Stop Analyzing Tools and Start Shipping
abstract: We spent way too much time arguing for which tool is the best. There isn't one. Instead, focus on solving actual business problems.

Quick one I thought after listening to the [2023 reflections](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/2023-reflections-looking-through-the-bottle/) episode of Frontend Happy Hour.

I enjoy programming. A lot. But sometimes I go into rabbit holes researching what tool should I use. TypeScript or Golang. HTMX or Nextjs.

Yes, learning new languages and frameworks is fun. However, there's something that I'd like to do more: shipping products.

Because that's where the real fun is at. Figuring out how you're going to solve an ambiguous problem.

So, instead of looking for opinions on what you should use, formulate your own. Try it out. Write code. Deploy. Ask some friends to test your app. Or maybe post on Twitter, LinkedIn or Product Hunt. I don't know. I do plan to find out.

So, I'm writing this down so I don't forget as well. It doesn't matter the technology. Solve issues. Fix real problems people are facing. That's why you got into software engineering in the first place.

Put yourself out there. Make something. And, don't focus on the outcome. Enjoy the journey instead.
