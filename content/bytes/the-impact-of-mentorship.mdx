But, what makes mentoring productive?

Your mentor should be someone who has relevant experience in the subject you want to learn.

If you want to be a CTO one day, look for someone who has experience leading teams.

If you want to work outside the company, look for someone who works or has worked for some time.

A mentoring relationship is a win-win.

As a mentor, it helps you grow, help others, and become a better leader in your career.

As a mentee, you will be able to gain a unique perspective on the situations you deal with. Understand how another person's experience can help you in your day-to-day life.

For leaders in companies: consider encouraging an internal mentoring program.

That's how I met my first mentor, who was responsible for ensuring that I received feedback that exceeded expectations in my first promotion cycle, after only 6 months of employment.

In addition, companies with mentoring programs have up to 64% lower employee turnover.
