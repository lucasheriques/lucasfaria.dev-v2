We all want to receive feedback.

But sometimes it's hard to find the constructive feedback that really helps us grow.

We often receive the famous Orkut testimonial. It's full of praise, and they really emphasize our strengths.

And it's important! But it's not the kind that gives us the best growth.

However, sometimes, when we receive constructive feedback, we get defensive.

We try to justify why we made a decision, and how it seemed right at the time.

The problem is that this discourages the person from giving us more constructive feedback in the future.

Before getting defensive, put yourself in the other person's shoes. Try to understand what led them to that reasoning.

And be grateful!

All feedback should be followed by gratitude.

After all, it's already rare for us to receive it. So, treat it as a gift when it happens.

In next week's article, I'll write tips on how to ask for feedback effectively.

The people who get promoted faster are those who welcome feedback with open arms and define clear action points based on it.

So, my first tip is: the next time you receive constructive feedback, start by saying thank you.

This shows that you are open to conversation, and will encourage the person to give you more feedback in the future.

And this will only enhance your professional growth.
