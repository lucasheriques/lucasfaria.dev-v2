An evergrowing collection of UI libraries I've found useful for creating magical interactions.

Especially useful for those animations that take the user experience to the next level. Who doesn't love to spark joy?

They all follow common conventions: TailwindCSS, Framer Motion and React. Same style as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): copy the source code and paste it in your project.
