When you grow up without references, your heroes come from books and screens.

I grew up with a schizophrenic mother and no father figure. Reality at home was... complicated.

It was in fiction that I found the mentors I never had.

Perhaps you'll identify with some of them (spoiler warning):

âœ¨ Kaladin Stormblessed (Stormlight Archive)
"The most important step a man can take is not the first one, but the next oneâ€”always the next step."

Kaladin taught me that even in the darkest moments, protecting others can save us.

âœ¨ Dalinar Kholin (also from Stormlight)
"The most important words a man can say are, 'I will do better.'"

From someone who accepted his mistakes and sought redemption, I learned that our past doesn't define our future.

âœ¨ Naruto
He had what I call "Talk no Jutsu" - the ability to connect with almost anyone through dialogue.

I discovered this is the most undervalued soft skill in behavioral interviews. Empathy beats technique.

âœ¨ Rock Lee
Without natural talent, he trained harder than anyone.

He showed me that hard work and consistency overcome talent when talent doesn't work hard.

âœ¨ Uncle Iroh (Avatar)
"It's important to ask yourself: who are you and what do YOU want?"

Iroh taught me to choose my own path and find beauty in simple things.

âœ¨ Aang
"The true mind can weather all lies and illusions without being lost."

Aang showed me that, eventually, we have to face our problems head-on - no matter how much we try to run away.

Fiction has power. Well-written characters can teach us lessons we might never learn on our own.

What about you? Which fictional character has most influenced your life? Share in the comments ðŸ‘‡

Or, better yet: you may already have people close to you who can help. Sometimes, our best mentors are closer than we imagine.

PS: If you're going through difficult times right now, find your mentors wherever you can. Sometimes, they're waiting in the pages of a book or the episodes of a series.
