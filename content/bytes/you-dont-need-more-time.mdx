I've always wanted more time.

When I was in college, I would leave at 9 am and come back at 11 pm, because I was working and studying.

And I thought: wow, when I graduate, it will be great.

I will have a lot of time to do everything.

But sometimes it seems like I have even less time ðŸ˜…

Of course, adult life brings responsibilities that we didn't think about.

But, what I often lack is focus.

That's why I wanted to bring this visual from [ashlamb.com](https://ashlamb.com).

This is something that Pat Walls teaches very well in the content he posts on [Starter Story](https://starterstory.com).

The power of Deep Work.

With 2 hours a day, consistently, we can achieve a lot.

So, the next time you find yourself without time, think about this.

Find the smallest interval of 30 minutes to 2 hours where you can dedicate yourself to a task.

And do it consistently.

You will be surprised by the results.
