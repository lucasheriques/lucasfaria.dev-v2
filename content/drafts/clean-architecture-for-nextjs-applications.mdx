Nextjs makes it very easy to build applications.

With its full stack capabilities, it's very easy to get started. You can create a new project from scratch, add a database ORM
like Drizzle or Prisma, call it directly from server components and you're good to go.

Yet, if you application takes off, it's important to have good practices in case.

It'll make your life easier in the long term, especially if you have to maintain it for some years or hire new engineers to help you
work on it.
