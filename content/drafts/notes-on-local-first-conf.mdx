## History

- Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDTs) is how the local-first movement kind of started. See the [original paper](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588/document).
- Local-first term was coined around 2019. [Original article here](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/).
- When thinking about the term, we wanted a different way to think that doesn't fit offline-first

## Definition

- **New definition for local-first: the availability of another computer should never prevent you from working**
- Make local-first apps ["incredible-journey-proof"](https://www.tumblr.com/ourincrediblejourney). Even if the app developer decides to kill the app, you should still be able to use it.

## Benefits for users

- Fast, no spinners
- Multi-device
- Works offline
- Seamless collaborations
- Long-term preservation
- Security & Privacy
- User control

[See more details here](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/).

- In an ideal world, we'd have a standardized protocol for creating local-first apps. This way, we could move accross different vendors and still have the same data.

## Benefits for app developers

- No backend engineering team
- No 24/7 on-call rotation
- No more network error handling code
- No more paying through the nose for cloud

## Changes on economics

Opportunity: easier, faster and cheaper to build collaboration-heavy apps (niche apps become viable)

Challenge: will SaaS still work? because the customers can just take their data somewhere else


## Tech examples

- Yjs: a CRDT library for building collaborative applications. [GitHub](https://github.com/yjs/yjs)
- Automerge


## Fundamentals

Local-first is a set of principles & values

It's a better way of building software and that is more important than any particualr technology/tool/product
