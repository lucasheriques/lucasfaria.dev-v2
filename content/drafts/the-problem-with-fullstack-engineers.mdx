title: "The Problem with Fullstack Engineers"
abstract: Typography is a fundamental aspect of any web page's design, shaping not only readability but also a site's overall personality. At the heart of this process is the CSS font-size property - a simple, yet incredibly versatile, tool that influences the visual hierarchy of our content.

**NOTE: this is an early draft that I'm working on, so it only contains the outline of my thought process so far.**


General idea: Fullstack engineers is not the best way to identify yourself. If you work on products, strive to be a product minded engineer instead. Organize around a business mission, on bringing real value to your users.

- I started out my career as a Frontend Engineer
- Slowly, I've began doing more backend as well. Not necessarialy because I want to, but because you need both (and a lot more) to build a product.
- However, I see a lot of people pursuing careers as a "Fullstack Engineers". However, what does full stack really mean?
- Is Fullstack only frontend and backend? Or do you also have to include databases, devops, and security? We can't know where to stop. There's [too much stack](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1659610352588562433).
- I think, if you are an engineer looking to build products, you need to stop focusing on the technology. Frontend, backend, databases. Not that this stuff doesn't matter. But building products just for the sake of building is not real engineering. You're just playing with code (which is not something bad! I love it, it's one of my favorite hobbies, beucase for me, programming feels like magic.)
- [Engineering is the practice of solving real-world problems with the tools we have at hand.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering)
- If you work primarialy on the frontend domain, but suddenly the service you consume is performing slower than anticipated, the best outcome is that you can go and investigate it yourself. Otherwise it just slows down everyone.
- Similarly, if you work on the backend, but gotta change some javascript in the front, ideally you shouldn't need to ask anyone to do that for you.
- This doesn't mean you have to know everything yourself. Software engineering isn't a lone wolf job, there's strength in collaboration.
- But being good enough to submit a PR every now and on a whole different service that you depend on is incredible valuable to achieve a good velocity.
- A separation that makes more sense, for me, is between Product Engineers vs Platform Engineers.
- Product Engineering focuses on a business mission. Usually external users, but not always. Plat
- Platform engineering focuses on the technical mission. It focuses on creating and supporting the underlying technology, tools and services that support the development and operation of software products.
- Today, I identify myself as a product engineer, and want to grow in that direction. But, similar to the [engineer and manager pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/), I believe there is good benefit towards working in both ends as well. Which is why, sometime in the future, I plan to make that switch also.
