- As a software engineer working on products, you're driven to solve a business decision.
- Yes, the tech stack is important too, but not as much as making sure you're building the right solution to the problem you're working on.
- Using product analytics is incredibly valuable to make sure you're on the right track.
- If there is anything that I want to have from is article, is this idea: product analytics are great to help you understand more about your customer behavior.
- By leveraging product analyitcs tools, you can understand how do they use your software, what are the pain points, and what features do they use the most.
- Maybe your feature that is not that well highlighted is actually your unfair advantage.
- To learn that, we use product analytics. So, my advice is: start tracking interactions. Make sure you undestand understand how to they use your app.
- I mean interactions, don't go doing anything with your users PII.
- So far on my career, I worked closely on the frontend/UI side, which is something I love and enjoy.
- However, I don't want to just be a developer. I also want to influence the product, the vision.
- To do that, I have to learn how to connect with users. One of the ways I found to be effective is by understanding how they use the product, what they like, what they don't like, and what they are trying to achieve.
- So recently, on my job, I started playing around with user tracking and analytics which led me to a lot of discoveries.
- On some context: I work for the Bill Pay team at Brex. My goal there is to make paying bills (a dull activity) feel like magic.
- My goal with this post is to also encourage you to try playing with metrics and analytics yourself. To explain what you can gain from it, your company and your users.
- A disclaimer: I don't think just data is enough to drive decisions. [As Airbnb's CEO, Brian Chesky, said it](https://youtu.be/4ef0juAMqoE?si=kaabuFMqGuMmRW8S&t=2210): teams should use data, but they also use research and intuition. However, I think it's a great way to start connecting more with your customers, especially if you don't dogfood your own product every day.
- With no more delongs, let's get this started.

# Driving product growth (to bring more revenue)

> Efficiency will be the mantra guiding how many companies operate, going forward. [Gergely Orosz, The Pragmatic Engineer.](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/141204650/more-doers-fewer-planners)

Companies are pressed to do more with less. That means that we can't really hire infinitely anymore and slowly catch up.

We're pressued to increase our company's revenue. Make a tangible impact on the business.

That means increasing customer acquisition, retention, activation, engagement, and monetization while also lowering the cost of customer acquisition. Creating a product so good people can't NOT recommend you to their friends.

This really bounds down to one issue: understanding where is your product failing. What are the pain points. What can you do to bring those people back. And to make sure you're on the right track towards sustainable growth, because the infinite VC money is over.


# It helps validate if you are building the correct stuff

Using product analytics helps you build a great feedback loop. I found it to be a variation of [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), with maybe a couple less steps:

1. Observe/ask questions
2. Implement
3. Measure
4. Share learnings

You may think that this is only valid for products that already have tons of usage and data to measure. I thought the same as well. But I don't think that's the case.

Even for early-state products, I feel like the only part that changes is the step 1. Instead of observing something in your customers, you see a problem that someone is facing on a real life. Something that can be improved with software.

From that observation, you build your MLP. Yes, you heard right. Not MVP. **MLP: minimum loveable product**.

Now, how do we know what is a MLP? That brings us to the next section.

# Building your product intuition

For me, when I started thinking about what could I measure to improve our product, it led to a much better outcome: understanding the questions I needed answers.

# Is a great way to measure

# It brings you closer to the customer, to your PM and designer

# On ethics and privacy
