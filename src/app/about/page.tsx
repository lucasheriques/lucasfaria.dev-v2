        When not coding, {"I'll"} probably be spending time with my fianc√©e and
        our <span className="line-through">children</span> pets, cooking,
        reading, or enjoying some time in nature. üçÇ

        In this page, {"you'll"} find some of my thoughts and projects. I divide
        my thoughts between two: ideas and bytes. Ideas are longer, more
        thought-out pieces, while bytes are shorter and more frequent.
